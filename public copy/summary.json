  "summary": "Based on the transcript, here is a clear and concise summary:\n\nThis transcript introduces Johnny Cage, a famous but somewhat washed-up action movie actor from the '90s. He is mysteriously recruited into Mortal Kombat, a brutal, to-the-death fighting tournament that he is told is a \"war for the fate of your world.\"\n\nInitially terrified and reluctant, Johnny insists he is just an actor and feels inadequate because he lacks the supernatural powers of the other fighters. However, he is urged to embrace his destiny and become a hero. Ultimately, he accepts the challenge, confronting enemies with his signature cocky attitude. The summary highlights iconic franchise moments and establishes Johnny's character, who relies on his fighting skill and wit rather than powers, cheekily stating his only \"power\" is being \"incredibly handsome.\""
