  "notes": "Of course. Here are the key points and main ideas from the transcript, presented in a structured format.\n\n### Introduction to Johnny Cage\n*   He is a well-known actor, famous for his past work, particularly the movie **\"Citizen Cage.\"**\n*   His career seems to have peaked in the past, with one character noting his work \"went out in the '90s.\"\n*   He is initially dismissive and skeptical when approached by mysterious figures, assuming they are just \"crazy fans.\"\n\n### The Call to Adventure: Mortal Kombat\n*   Johnny Cage is informed that he has been **\"chosen to fight\"** in a tournament.\n*   The event is called **Mortal Kombat**, a brutal competition where fights are **\"to the death.\"**\n*   The stakes are incredibly high, described as a **\"war for the fate of your world.\"**\n*   The central theme is survival, as highlighted by the lyric, \"Only the strong survive.\"\n\n### Johnny's Internal Conflict and Reluctance\n*   Cage feels completely unprepared and unqualified for the tournament.\n*   He emphasizes that he is just a normal person, contrasting himself with others who have supernatural abilities like **\"Transformer arms\" or shoot \"lightning bolts.\"**\n*   He tries to remove himself from the situation, insisting, \"This shit's got nothing to do with me. I'm an actor.\"\n*   He shows fear and vulnerability, reacting with \"Fuck that\" to a violent act and protecting his face during a fight.\n\n### Acceptance and Key Moments\n*   A character encourages him to embrace his potential, telling him, \"It's time... to become the hero you were meant to be.\"\n*   Cage eventually accepts his role, confronting an opponent with his signature catchphrase: **\"It's showtime.\"**\n*   The transcript features several iconic phrases from the *Mortal Kombat* franchise:\n    *   \"Get over here!\"\n    *   \"Finish him!\"\n    *   \"Mortal Kombat!\"\n*   **Key Reveal:** An opponent is shocked to discover Cage has no powers. Johnny's response defines his character: **\"I'm just incredibly handsome.\"** This suggests he relies on skill, wit, and charisma rather than supernatural abilities."
